 * This is the equivalent of the standard blink sketch for an ESC.
 * It will pulse the ESC with a throttle of 0% / 20%, changing every 5s.
 * The value is sent roughly with a 5kHz loop rate.
 * Depending on the duration of your startup melody, the last beep may be delayed until the throttle reaches 0%.
